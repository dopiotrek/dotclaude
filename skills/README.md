# Skills

Reusable procedures Claude Code can run. Each skill is a directory with a
`SKILL.md` (frontmatter + instructions) and optional `references/` and
`scripts/`. `install.sh` symlinks this whole directory to `~/.claude/skills/`,
so these are **user-level** skills available in every project.

## How a skill is invoked

- **By command:** type `/<directory-name>` (e.g. `/clean-comments`). The command
  is the **directory** name, not the `name` field — keep them the same to avoid
  confusion.
- **Automatically:** Claude reads each skill's `description` every turn and loads
  the body when it matches your prompt. Add a `paths` glob to auto-trigger only
  when working with matching files.

Unlike agents (which run in their own context), a skill's body loads into the
current conversation when it runs.

## Frontmatter

| Property                   | Required | Purpose                                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`                     | yes      | Listing label. Keep equal to the directory name.                   |
| `description`              | yes      | When Claude should auto-load it; trigger phrases.                  |
| `paths`                    | no       | Glob(s) that scope auto-activation to matching files.              |
| `allowed-tools`            | no       | Tools pre-approved while the skill is active.                      |
| `disable-model-invocation` | no       | `true` = only you can run it (`/name`), never auto-loaded.          |
| `user-invocable`           | no       | `false` = hidden from the `/` menu; Claude-only background knowledge.|

# My Skill

What it does, the workflow, and examples.
```

Keep one skill single-purpose, give it a specific `description` (that's what
makes auto-activation reliable), and put long reference material in
`references/` so it only loads when the skill runs.
