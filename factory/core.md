# Core (every agent, local or cloud)

- Stack: SvelteKit, Svelte 5 (runes only), TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, Postgres, Turborepo.
- pnpm only, never npm or yarn.
- Never read or display `.env` contents. Never print secrets.
- Never use `any` without a written reason.
- Never delete data without explicit confirmation from Piotrek.
- Never put fake or placeholder data in production code.
- Before adding a dependency, check for an existing one that does the job.
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`), small and focused.
- Plain, simple English in PRs, docs and UI copy: short sentences, common words.
