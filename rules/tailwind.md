# Tailwind v4

Shared mechanics only. Tokens, colours, radius and elevation names are per
repo — look them up in the repo's theme CSS and design docs. Repo rules win on
a conflict. Motion rules live in `motion.md`.

## Classes that compile to nothing

No build step catches a class that generates no CSS. It ships silently.

- **Only registered utilities.** Never `bg-[--var-name]`: arbitrary syntax over
  a custom property gives an empty rule in v4. Use the name the theme
  registers.
- **Copied class strings lie.** A class from another repo, an older file, or
  `shadcn-svelte add` output may not exist here. Our repos have drifted apart
  on colour aliases, grey ramps and shadow names. Check each class against
  this repo's theme before you keep it.
- **The scanner reads text, not code.** It does not evaluate template
  literals. A whole class inside a literal is fine. A class built by joining a
  variant prefix to a value (`` `[&_svg]:${x}` ``) never exists as text, so it
  is never generated. Write it out in full.

## `@theme inline` emits no variables

`@theme inline` puts values into utility classes and nothing else.
`var(--color-surface)` is undefined in plain CSS: a `<style>` block, a
`style:` binding, an `@utility` body. There, use the raw token variable the
theme is built from.

A custom property that holds a `calc()` is not evaluated until something uses
it. `getPropertyValue()` returns the expression text. Read the computed value
off an element instead.

## Class logic

- `cn()` for every conditional class. No ternaries inside a class string, and
  no `class:` directive.

## Sizing and layout

- `h-dvh` / `min-h-svh`, never `h-screen` (breaks on mobile Safari). Fixed and
  sticky elements respect `safe-area-inset-*`.
- `size-*` for square elements, not `w-* h-*`.
- Flex or grid with `gap-*`, not `space-y-*`.
- Table row height goes on the `<td>`. The table layout ignores a height on a
  `<tr>`.
- z-index uses only the 0 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 scale: base, raised card,
  sticky header, dropdown/popover, modal, toast. Never `z-[…]`.

## Typography

- `text-balance` on headings, `text-pretty` on body text.
- `tabular-nums` on all numeric data. `font-mono` for ids and codes.
- Do not change `tracking-*` unless asked.

## Values and elevation

- Default spacing scale before arbitrary values like `p-[18px]`.
- Never stock `shadow-sm` / `shadow-md` / `shadow-lg` or arbitrary
  `shadow-[…]`. Elevation comes from the repo's registered utilities.
- Radius and shadow scales are custom per repo. A t-shirt name like
  `rounded-md` can resolve to a real but wrong value, so it fails silently.
  Check the repo's scale.
- A surface whose edge is a ring lives in `box-shadow`. Do not add `border`
  next to it — the edges double.
- No gradients or glow / coloured shadows unless asked.

## `!important`

Two uses only, each with a short inline comment that says why:

- A third-party DOM override where Vite's CSS order makes our rule lose at
  equal specificity.
- The global `prefers-reduced-motion` backstop.

Anywhere else, the selector or token chain is wrong. Fix that instead.
