# Code comments

Comments are rare by default. A file I open should read as code, not as code
buried in narration. If a comment only tells me what the next line already
says, it is noise and it must not be written.

Write a comment only when it carries one of these:

- **Why, not what** — a constraint, a workaround, a trade-off, a decision that
  looks wrong until you know the reason ("Supabase returns `null` here for
  RLS-denied rows, not an error").
- **A non-obvious gotcha** — an ordering requirement, a race, a magic number's
  source, an upstream bug being worked around (link the issue).
- **A pointer** — where the real explanation lives (`see .docs/decisions/…`).

Never write:

- Restatements of the code (`// increment the counter`, `// import the store`).
- Section headers inside a short function (`// --- validation ---`).
- JSDoc that only repeats parameter names and types the signature already
  gives. Add JSDoc when the behaviour needs prose, not as a default wrapper.
- File-top banners describing what the file obviously is.
- Comments that narrate the change you just made (`// added error handling`,
  `// new in this refactor`). Commits carry that.
- Placeholder or aspirational comments (`// TODO: maybe improve later`) —
  deferred work goes in root `TODO.md`.

Rules of thumb:

- When editing an existing file, match its comment density. Do not add a
  commenting style the file did not have.
- If a comment feels needed to explain a confusing block, first try renaming or
  extracting until the code says it itself; comment only what is left.
- If asked to explain a specific function or file, comment it fully — this is
  about the default, not a ban.
