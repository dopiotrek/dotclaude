# UX content (in-app copy)

Text inside the app. A repo's own marketing-copy doc wins for public pages.

## Voice

- Direct and personal: "you", "your". Friendly, not casual. Not formal, not
  passive.
- Less is more. Say the important thing first and cut the rest.
- Use the user's words, never internal or technical terms.
- Same action, same words, everywhere in the product.

## Buttons and microcopy

- Aim for **under 8 words**.
- Name the exact action: "Save changes", not "Submit"; "Continue to review",
  not "Proceed". Never "OK" or "Click here".
- Link text makes sense on its own. Never "read more".
- Warmth or a light joke only on 404 pages and empty states.
- Empty state: one short line on what will appear here, and one next action.
  Never show a blank table or a chart with zero data.

## Error messages

- Say what went wrong **and** how to fix it.
- Take the blame. Never blame the user. "Please" is fine.
- Calm words. No "critical" or "fatal", and no bare "Error".
- Never point by color or position ("the red button", "click here"). Name the
  control: "click the Help button".

| Don't              | Do                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| "Invalid input"    | "Enter a date in DD.MM.YYYY format"          |
| "Fatal error"      | "Something went wrong. Please try again."    |
| "Error in field 3" | "Your email address is missing the @ symbol" |

## Risky and destructive states

- Warning and destructive states use the design system's warning / destructive
  tokens. Do not invent other colors for alerts. A color reserved for one
  alert type stays reserved for it.
- Always pair the color with an icon and a text label.
- A destructive action always goes through a confirm dialog with a destructive
  button. Never an implicit or auto-submitting destructive action.

## Codes and identifiers

- Codes and IDs (reference numbers, IBANs, transaction IDs): `font-mono
  tabular-nums`, codes in uppercase. Never wrap or truncate in the middle of a
  token.

## Mobile layout

- Minimum font size **16px**.
- Key facts (status, amounts, main actions) visible without scrolling.
- Content-heavy pages start with a short summary or lead value.
- Prefer bullets, subheadings and short paragraphs over long prose.

## Images and logos

- File names: English, lowercase, hyphens only; number suffix for more of the
  same topic (`team-meeting-2.jpg`). Max **100 KB** per image.
- No fitting image: use a colored background, not a filler image.
- Several partner logos: alphabetical order, unless a weighting is decided on
  purpose.
