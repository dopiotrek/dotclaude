# Forms

SvelteKit form actions validated with Zod. Which form library a repo uses (plain `request.formData()` or superforms) is set in the repo's own `forms.md` — follow that, and do not mix the two without a reason.

## Validation

- Always validate on the server, even when the client already validated.
- A Zod message is the sentence the user reads: `"Give the group a name."`, not `"Invalid input"`. When you surface only the first issue, keep a fallback sentence.
- A schema that encodes a contract with another system (a code compared as text, an external ID format) lives at module scope with a short comment saying what breaks if it changes.

## Partial updates

An absent key is not `null`. When a form posts only some fields (a single cell, a role or note edit), check `formData.has(key)` before you write a field. Treating an absent key as `null` silently clears a field the user never touched.

superforms' `superValidate` fills missing optional fields from the schema, so an absent key arrives as `null`. Do not use it for partial updates — read the raw `formData` instead.

## Small actions

A one-shot post (delete, toggle, a checkbox that saves on change, a row or menu action) has no form UI to bind. Use `request.formData()` + Zod `safeParse`. Do not build a full form for it.

## Client

- `use:enhance` with `reset: false` when the fields mirror server state, so the saved values stay on screen after a save.
- If the page copies server data into local `$state`, copy it again after the action (see `svelte5.md`).

## Breaking the repo's pattern

When an action deliberately uses the other pattern (superforms in a plain-Zod repo, or raw `formData` in a superforms repo), say why in a one- or two-line comment at the action. The next reader then knows the two patterns exist on purpose.

## Order inside an action

Check auth and permission first, then parse the input, then scope to the
tenant, then write. A request the user may not make is refused before its
body is read. (Decided 2026-10-03 for every repo; older actions that parse
first get fixed when you touch them.)

## Which form library

The repo's own `forms.md` names it; follow the repo. A new repo starts with
plain `formData` + Zod.
