# UX accessibility

Target: WCAG 2.1 Level AA for everything new. You know the WCAG basics. This
file lists only the choices we made on top of them, or where we are stricter.

## Structure

- DOM order matches visual reading order. Do not use CSS (`order`, grid
  placement) to show content in a different order than the DOM.
- Do not hide important information inside accordions. Keep it visible.
- Put items in order of importance. The primary action must not need searching.
- Use a semantic element only when the content really means it. A wrong
  semantic element is worse than a neutral `<div>` / `<span>`.
- Dates: always `<time datetime="YYYY-MM-DD">`, whatever the visible text says.
- Page title: `[Company name] + [Page description]`, unique per page.

## Keyboard and focus

- Focus order is top to bottom. Exception: a close ("X") button gets focus
  **last** in its group, not first.
- `Esc` closes a modal, menu or dropdown and returns focus to the element that
  opened it.
- Tooltips open on keyboard focus too, not only on hover.
- Focus: use the repo's one focus treatment (its design rule names it). Never
  remove the outline without a visible replacement.
- Screen reader target for testing is NVDA.

## Forms

- The label is always visible. A placeholder is never the label.
- Mark the **optional** fields, not the required ones.
- Show format rules and requirements before the user types, not only in the
  error.
- On submit: a summary of all errors at the top of the form, and each message
  again directly below its field, linked with `aria-describedby`.
- Long forms: split into groups with `<fieldset>` + `<legend>`.

## Size and text layout

- Hit area at least **44×44 CSS px** for every interactive element. This is
  stricter than AA on purpose.
- Body text line height at least **1.5×** the font size; paragraph spacing at
  least 1.5× the line height.
- Left-align body text. Never justify it.
- Accessible names (`aria-label`, alt text) stay short: screen reader users hear
  every word.

Wording of labels, buttons and error messages: see `ux-content.md`.
