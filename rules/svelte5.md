# Svelte 5 + UI

Loads when working in Svelte files. The runes-only rule also lives in `CLAUDE.md` (always-on), so it still applies when you create a new component from scratch. Repo rules add the component library, icons and motion.

## Runes and state

- Svelte 5 runes only: `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`. Never Svelte 4 patterns: no `writable` / `derived` stores, no `$:` statements, no `export let`.
- Prefer `$derived` for computed values. Use `$effect` only for real side effects (DOM, subscriptions, logging), never to derive state.
- Use `$app/state`, not the deprecated `$app/stores`.
- Props: `let { a, b = 0 }: Props = $props();` with an `interface Props`. Never `$props<Props>()`.
- Shared reactive state lives in a `*.svelte.ts` module.
- Reactive collections come from `svelte/reactivity` (`SvelteSet`, `SvelteMap`, `SvelteURLSearchParams`), not a plain `Set` or `URLSearchParams` inside `$state`.

## Capturing props in `$state`

- An editable form may copy a prop's first value into `$state` (`let name = $state(data.user.name)`). This is the only case where `// svelte-ignore state_referenced_locally` is allowed.
- Anything that should follow the prop is `$derived`. A suppressed warning on a captured `const` hides a value that goes stale. Never suppress the warning in config.
- If you copy server data into local `$state` and a `use:enhance` action changes it, copy it again from `data` after `await update({ reset: false })`. A list that renders straight from `data` (or a `$derived` over it) is refreshed by invalidation and needs no copy.

## Effect loops (`effect_update_depth_exceeded`)

These have taken down whole screens. Two shapes:

- An `$effect` that reads and writes the same reactive object. Read each dependency into a local first. Wrap the write in `untrack()`. Guard with `!==` so a no-op write does not fire. Only write calculated fields.
- An effect that pushes into a `$state` array (for example a registry held in context). `push` reads `length`, so the effect depends on its own write. Wrap the `push` and the cleanup `splice` in `untrack()`. Keep the read that decides *whether* to register tracked.

## Hydration traps

- A component that writes into a context during init (a field registering its label, and anything built like it) must wrap that write in `untrack()`. Otherwise every screen that uses it dies at hydration.
- A `$bindable("")` prop bound to `undefined` throws `props_invalid_value` and takes the page down. Make the prop optional (`note?: string`) with no fallback. The symptom looks like a stale dev server (no autosave, effects not firing, selects that will not open). Check the console for `props_invalid_value` before you restart anything.
- State that changes the *number* of rendered rows or cells (page size, visible columns, expanded rows) must not come from `localStorage`. The server cannot read it, so SSR and hydration render different trees and Svelte keeps the mismatch. Use a cookie. `localStorage` is fine for state that only changes an attribute, like a width.

## `requestSubmit()` sends the previous value

A hidden `<input value={state}>` read by a programmatic `requestSubmit()` sends the value from *before* the last write. The form is serialised before Svelte flushes, and `tick()` does not help. Put the fields into the request at submit time, read straight from state. Never round-trip form state through the DOM.

## Components (shadcn-svelte / bits-ui)

- Multi-part components (`Card`, `Dialog`, `Select`, `Tabs` …) are imported as a namespace from their own sub-path: `import * as Dialog from "…/ui/dialog"`. Keep this even where a lint or style rule discourages namespace imports — it matches the upstream docs, and these components each export a bare `Root`.
- bits-ui `Select`: use `bind:value` or `onValueChange`. `onSelectedChange` is another library's API and does nothing.
- An icon-only button or link needs an `aria-label`. The accessible name goes on the control, never on the icon.
- Import icons one per file from the icon's own path, never from the package barrel. The barrel re-exports every icon and slows the compile a lot.

## Template gotchas

- `{@const}` can only be a direct child of a block (`{#if}`, `{#each}`, `{#snippet}`, a component …), not of a plain element like `<div>`. Derive the value in the script instead.

## Conventions

- File names are kebab-case (`account-card.svelte`).
- Mobile-first: build the small-screen layout first, then scale up.
