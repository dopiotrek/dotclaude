# `.docs/` conventions

`.docs/` holds what the next session needs and cannot read from the code. It is not a place for working files, data exports or history — git keeps history.

## Tree

```
.docs/
  README.md      entry point: one line per folder + a "task → file" table. Max ~6 KB. Update it when you add a doc.
  handoff.md     the LAST session only. Overwrite it; never append. Max ~8 KB.
  product/       WHAT — concept, glossary, user-visible behaviour        status: living
  decisions/     WHY  — ADRs. Never edit once accepted; supersede them   status: proposed | accepted | superseded
  engineering/   HOW  — the system as it is now; must match the code     status: living
  specs/         PLAN — a feature before it is built                     status: draft | approved | built
  research/      EVIDENCE — market, users, competitors; frozen on its date
  reviews/       AUDITS — `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`; frozen; findings go to TODO
  _archive/      dead docs, same subfolders. Do not read unless asked or linked from a live doc.
```

No other top-level folders and no other files at the root. Inside a folder, add subfolders only past ~15 files.

Frontmatter on every doc in `product/`, `decisions/`, `engineering/`, `specs/`:

```yaml
---
title: Short title
status: living # one of the values for its folder, above
last_updated: 2026-10-03
context_for_ai: One or two lines — when to read this doc and what to read first.
---
```

## Life cycle — a doc that is no longer true leaves

- **Spec built** → move what stays true into `engineering/` or `product/`, set `status: built`, move the spec to `_archive/specs/`.
- **ADR superseded** → `status: superseded`, add `superseded_by:` with the link, move it to `_archive/decisions/`.
- **Review older than 60 days** → check that its open findings are in TODO, then move it to `_archive/reviews/`.
- **engineering/ or product/ doc is wrong** → fix it now, or archive it. Never leave a wrong doc next to correct ones.
- **When you move or rename a doc**, fix every link to it: `grep -rn 'old-name.md' .docs CLAUDE.md .claude`.

## Not in `.docs/`

- Working data — CSV, JSON exports, keyword lists, screenshots, video → `gtm/` (or another root folder) or gitignored.
- Client or third-party files (contracts, workbooks, PDFs) → never in the repo.
- Build output, generated HTML, logs, scripts.

## Handoff

`handoff.md` has five sections: **Goal**, **State**, **Decisions — do not relitigate**, **Next steps**, **Blockers**. Write it fresh at the end of a session. The previous one is in git history. Lasting lessons go into `engineering/` or a decision, not into the handoff.

Check a repo with `docs-lint` (in `~/.claude/scripts`).
