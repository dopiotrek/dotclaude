# Motion

Shared motion rules. Duration and easing token names and values are per
repo — look them up in the repo's theme CSS. Repo rules win on a conflict.

## When to animate

- Default to no animation. Decoration is never a reason.
- Bias functional: short and clean deep in a flow. Expressive motion belongs
  at entry points and needs a reason.

## What may move

- Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Never `top`, `left`, `width`,
  `margin` or `padding`.
- No `transition-all`. It picks up layout properties.
- Tailwind v4 `translate-*` utilities set the `translate` property, not
  `transform`. A keyframe that writes `transform` composes with them. So do
  not convert a `translate-*` centring to a `transform` utility — the
  keyframe would overwrite it.

## Timing

- Routine interaction feedback (hover, focus, press, toggle) stays at or
  under 200ms.
- Use the repo's named `duration-*` and `ease-*` utilities. Never arbitrary
  `duration-[Xms]` or an inline `cubic-bezier(…)`.
- Entrances and state changes decelerate (an ease-out curve). Use the repo's
  named curve, not Tailwind's stock `ease-out`, where the repo defines one.
- Stagger related elements so the eye follows one thing at a time. Keep each
  step at 100ms or less. Never delay interaction feedback.

## Where animations live

- Keyframes and `animate-*` utilities live in the repo's shared animations
  stylesheet, composed from the duration and easing tokens. Never inline
  keyframes in a component.
- Before you add a utility, check whether one already exists. Before you use
  one, check it still exists — unused keyframes get removed.

## Reduced motion

- Every animated element carries `motion-reduce:transition-none` or
  `motion-reduce:animate-none` at the usage site.
- The global `prefers-reduced-motion` guard is a backstop only. It does not
  replace the variant. It is one of the two sanctioned `!important` uses
  (see `tailwind.md`).
