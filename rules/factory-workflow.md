# Factory workflow

Applies in a repo whose root `package.json` has a `verify` script. Elsewhere,
ignore this file.

## One task, one worktree, one PR

- Work in a git worktree on its own branch, never in the main checkout and
  never on `main`. Other sessions may be running in the main checkout. If the
  session did not start in a worktree (`claude -w <slug>`), create one with
  the worktree tool before the first edit.
- In a cloud session (a fresh clone, `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`) the clone is
  already isolated: work on its branch, no worktree needed.
- In a new worktree, run `pnpm install` first. `.worktreeinclude` copies the
  `.env` files.
- Commit in small steps on the branch. Conventional commit messages.

## Done means `pnpm verify` passes

- `pnpm verify` is the definition of done. Run it before you call work
  complete and report its last lines. If it fails, fix the cause; do not
  weaken, skip or delete a check or a test to make it pass.
- If a check cannot run here (no database, no network), say which one and why.

## Landing

1. `git push -u origin HEAD`
2. `gh pr create --fill` — the body says what changed, why, how it was
   verified, and lists any new migration or env variable.
3. `gh pr merge --auto --squash` — GitHub merges only after required CI
   checks pass. Never use `--admin`, never merge a red PR, never push to `main`.
4. Write `.docs/handoff.md` on the branch if the work is not finished.

Production deploys are not part of a task. They happen from `main` after merge.

## Work queue

`TODO.md` items tagged `[agent]` are ready for an unattended agent. The
`next-task` skill takes them one at a time. Do not tag an item `[agent]` unless
it says what to change and how to check it is done.
